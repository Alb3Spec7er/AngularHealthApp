Angular Health App
==================

01 - This is the shell for the Angular health app. It is the minimum needed for a working Angular application and a
ready-made test harness.

02 - The next step is to refactor the setup for the app to a separate file, and include it in the test harness so that
the tests will run against the app. 

The app is for a health calculator, so one of the first specifications is to ensure the formula for BMI calculates 
correctly. Of course, because there is no function the code will fail at first.
